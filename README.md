# Data Science Project

This project looks at the ability to quantify footballer's shot quality with statistics and if there is variation over time and across players. It looks at how you can best look at shot quality using available data as well as trying to make its own metrics to give further analysis as to how good a shot is. This information could then be useful in player evaluation and trying to improve both player and team performance.
